Although the idea didn't gain traction initially, it was revived in 1909 by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington, United States.

From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill.

The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of trinitrotoluene (TNT), a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like Arizona's Barringer, Quebec's Manicouagan and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth.", "headline": "Rock-solid defense", "quiz_url": "https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20250630_WolfeCrater\"&FORM=BGAQ", "map_image": "https://platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/-19.1731,127.789299/4?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-GB&od=2&shading=flat&pp=-19.1731,127.789299;S9;Wolfe Creek Meteorite Crater, Western Australia, Australia&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro", "map_url": "https://www.bing.com/maps?ty=30&q=Wolfe%20Creek%20Meteorite%20Crater%2C%20Western%20Australia&vdpid=8715429198254047233&ss=ypid.YN3724x2869395793350722944&mb=-19.155464~127.773465~-19.189104~127.81779&description=Wolfe%20Creek%20Crater%20Road%2C%20Halls%20Creek%20Western%20Australia%206770&cardbg=%233DB838&dt=1747603800000&tt=Wolfe%20Creek%20Crater%20National%20Park&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253DWolfe%252520Creek%252520Meteorite%252520Crater%25252C%252520Western%252520Australia%2526vdpid%253D8715429198254047233%2526ss%253Dypid.YN3724x2869395793350722944%2526mb%253D-19.155464~127.773465~-19.189104~127.81779%2526description%253DWolfe%252520Creek%252520Crater%252520Road%25252C%252520Halls%252520Creek%252520Western%252520Australia%2525206770%2526cardbg%253D%2525233DB838%2526dt%253D1747603800000&tstt0=Wolfe%20Creek%20Crater%20National%20Park&cp=-22.617073~117.794421&lvl=4.4754977&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=BGAM"}

Canada Day is a nod to the moment when the country officially came together in 1867. What began as a confederation of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia has grown into a nation of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country's 'Independence Day' in the American sense, it's the closest thing to it. Locals celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts and community events. Ottawa, the capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill. Red-and-white flags, maple leaf face paint and singalongs of the national anthem, 'O Canada,' are all part of the day.", "headline": "Canada turns 158", "quiz_url": "https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20250701_CanadaDayFogo\"&FORM=BGAQ", "map_image": "https://platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/49.637852,-54.308758/4?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-GB&od=2&shading=flat&pp=49.637852,-54.308758;S9;Fogo Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro", "map_url": "https://www.bing.com/maps?ty=30&q=fogo%20island%2C%20newfoundland%20and%20labrador&vdpid=5327985602409267201&mb=49.964298~-54.604168~49.558594~-53.410686&cardbg=%23F98745&dt=1747290600000&tt=Fogo%20Island%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253Dfogo%252520island%25252C%252520newfoundland%252520and%252520labrador%2526vdpid%253D5327985602409267201%2526mb%253D49.964298~-54.604168~49.558594~-53.410686%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745%2526dt%253D1747290600000&tstt0=Fogo%20Island%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador&cp=44.605917~-72.861005&lvl=4.295408&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=BGAM"}
